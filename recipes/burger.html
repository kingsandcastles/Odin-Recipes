    <h2>Eat beef.</h2>
    <p>You know the drill. Made in america and made in the midwest. The pride and joy of knowing 
        that your local farmer would be hard at work at your next big burger barbecue. Know your 
        products and know them well. Drive your truck and drive home the flavor of midwest beef.</p>

        <li>2 lbs ground beef</li>

        <li>2 tbsp dijon mustard</li>
        <li>2 tbsp worcestershire sauce</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix by hand the ground beef, salt, pepper, dijon mustard and worcestershire sauce.</li>
        <li>Form light to medium size patties. You want fully cooked patties. This is not a steak.</li>
