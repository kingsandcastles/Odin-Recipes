    <h2>Pizza really is a universal language.</h2>
    <p>Yea, we are getting pretty cheesy in here, but look at the tomato field. Many pizza are great, 
        and many are trash. What I am really getting at is an appreciation of quality. May it not be 
        for the greatest of chefs to accomplish a simple task, but for them to do it of a high standard.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 premade pizza dough</li>
        <li>1/2 cup pizza sauce</li>
        <li>2 cups sliced mozzarella</li>
        <li>1/4 cup parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1/8 cup fresh basil leaves</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 475F and start your mise en place for your pizza.</li>
        <li>On a floured surface, roll and toss your dough into a proper pizza shape.</li>
        <li>Spread your pizza sauce, layer your parmesan cheese, and place your mozzarella cheese pieces.</li>
        <li>Bake for 15 minutes until the crust is lightly browned. Don't burn your pizza.</li>
        <li>Gently and lightly layer the leaves over your finished pizza.</li>
    </ol>
